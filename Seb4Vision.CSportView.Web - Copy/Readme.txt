The problem was in aspnet-prerendering module it looks like this in View>>Home>>Index.csHtml

<app asp-prerender-module="ClientApp/dist/main-server">Loading...</app>
Then when i removed it the app works fine

<app>Loading...</app>
but there is no server-side rendering of course by this so when i finished from developing the app i write this command in root directory of my project

webpack --config webpack.config.vendor.js
webpack
and restored the

<app asp-prerender-module="ClientApp/dist/main-server">Loading...</app>
and it works as it should be :)


	dotnet publish -c release
